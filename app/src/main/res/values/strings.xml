    <string name="content_text">At Maldron Hotel Smithfield, there exists a secret hallway. A hallway which is accessible
    through two doors. It might look like any ordinary hallway, but once inside there is no escape.
    In the middle of the hallway, up a small flight of stairs, a telephone is fastened to the wall.
    If you were to put the telephone to your ear, the only thing you would hear is
    \"What the feck dude. You\'re not supposed to go into that hallway. Ugh, I guess I\'ll come let you out\"</string>
